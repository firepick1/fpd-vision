### FirePick Delta Vision Laboratory
This repository comprises a collection of experiments that explore the 
capabilities of using computer vision to coordinate movement in
FirePick Delta. The primary use case for FirePick Delta is _pick-and-place_,
which requires sub-millimeter accuracy in the manipulation of extremely
small electronic packages. High-end commercial pick-and-place machines
rely on vision to improve accuracy and throughput. Our goal with
FirePick Delta is to prove that vision can also be applied to
inexpensive machines to attain comparable levels of accuracy 
by detecting and compensating for manufacturing
and assembly errors introduced in the creation of any individual
FirePick Delta.
